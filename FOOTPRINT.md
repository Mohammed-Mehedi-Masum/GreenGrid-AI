# üåç Carbon Footprint Measurement Methodology

## Overview

I measured the carbon footprint of my ML models during **inference**, not training, because in real-world deployments, models are used thousands of times each year across millions of devices. Training happens only once, but inference runs continuously ‚Äî so that's where most of the energy impact lies.

## Measurement Approach

### 1. Inference Time Measurement

I used Python's built-in `time.time()` function to measure how long each model takes to make predictions:

```python
import time

# Measure RandomForest inference time
start = time.time()
rf_predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test_scaled)
rf_time = time.time() - start

# Measure Ridge inference time
start = time.time()
ridge_predictions = ridge_model.predict(X_test_scaled)
ridge_time = time.time() - start
```

**Results:**

- **RandomForest:** ~100ms per prediction (averaged over 29,040 test samples)
- **Ridge:** ~5ms per prediction (around 20√ó faster)

### 2. Energy Consumption Calculation

Since I didn't have access to hardware-based power measurement tools (like CodeCarbon), I estimated energy use based on typical CPU power consumption.

**Assumptions:**

- **CPU Power Draw:** 15 watts during inference (a conservative estimate for an Intel i7)
- Typical desktop CPU runs at 10‚Äì20W under moderate load
- **Formula:** Energy (kWh) = Power (W) √ó Time (hours) / 1000

**Calculation Example (RandomForest):**

```
Time per prediction: 100ms = 0.0000278 hours
Annual predictions per meter: 8,760 (hourly forecasts)
Number of smart meters: 5,000,000
Total predictions: 43,800,000,000

Total runtime: 100ms √ó 43.8B = 4.38B ms = 1,217 hours
Energy: 15W √ó 1,217 hours / 1000 = 18.25 kWh
```

**Calculation Example (Ridge):**

```
Time per prediction: 5ms = 0.00000139 hours
Total runtime: 5ms √ó 43.8B = 219M ms = 60.8 hours
Energy: 15W √ó 60.8 hours / 1000 = 0.913 kWh
```

### 3. Carbon Emissions Calculation

I converted energy usage into CO‚ÇÇ emissions using the US grid's average carbon intensity.

**Carbon Intensity:** 0.4 kg CO‚ÇÇ per kWh  
**Source:** US EPA average grid emission factor

**Calculation:**

- **RandomForest:** 18.25 kWh √ó 0.4 = 7.3 kg CO‚ÇÇ/year
- **Ridge:** 0.0913 kWh √ó 0.4 = 0.0365 kg CO‚ÇÇ/year
- **Savings:** 7.3 ‚àí 0.0365 = 7.26 kg CO‚ÇÇ/year (‚âà99.5% reduction)

### 4. Model Quality Verification

I verified that the optimized model maintained accuracy while using far less energy.

**Metrics:**

- **RandomForest:** MAE = 1,621.03 MW, R¬≤ = 0.9076
- **Ridge:** MAE = 1,629.02 MW, R¬≤ = 0.9106
- **Accuracy Loss:** Only 8 MW difference (‚âà0.5% relative error increase)
- **R¬≤ Actually Improved!** Ridge performed slightly better

This shows that the carbon savings didn't come from sacrificing quality ‚Äî the Ridge model is simply more efficient.

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **No Hardware Measurement:** Used estimated CPU power (15W) instead of actual readings
2. **Constant Power Assumption:** Real devices vary power draw depending on load
3. **CPU Only:** GPU not considered (Ridge doesn't require one)
4. **Grid Carbon:** Used US average (0.4 kg/kWh), though this varies by region and time

### How I'd Improve This

If I had more resources, I'd take these steps:

**1. Use CodeCarbon Library:**

```python
from codecarbon import EmissionsTracker
tracker = EmissionsTracker()
tracker.start()
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
emissions = tracker.stop()
```

**2. Measure on Real Hardware:**

- Deploy on a Raspberry Pi 4 (a typical edge device)
- Use a USB power meter to record actual wattage
- Test in different regions (coal-heavy vs renewable grids)

**3. Dynamic Power Profiling:**

- Measure idle vs. inference power
- Account for CPU frequency scaling
- Test under varying workloads

**4. Regional Carbon Grid Data:**

- Use real-time carbon intensity APIs
- Compare worst-case (coal-heavy) and best-case (renewable-heavy) scenarios

## Reproducibility

Anyone can reproduce these measurements easily:

1. **Run the Notebook:** All code is in `GREEN_AI_SOLUTION.ipynb`
2. **Check Timing:** Cell 12 includes model training and timing results
3. **Verify Calculations:** All formulas are explained in comments
4. **Random Seed:** Set to `random_state=42` for reproducibility

## Tools Used

- **Python:** 3.12.7
- **Timing:** `time.time()` (built-in)
- **Model Size:** Measured using `pickle`
- **Assumptions:** Conservative CPU power estimates

## References

- **US Grid Carbon Intensity:** EPA eGRID database
- **CPU Power Consumption:** Intel TDP specifications
- **Deployment Scale:** US smart meter statistics (70M+ meters installed)

**Note:** These are conservative estimates. Real-world deployments could save even more carbon if:

- Models run on lower-power ARM processors (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
- Grids shift further toward renewables (lower carbon intensity)
- Forecast accuracy improves grid efficiency beyond the 3% assumption
