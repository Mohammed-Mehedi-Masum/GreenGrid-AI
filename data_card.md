# üìä Data Card: PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Dataset

## Dataset Overview

**Name:** PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Data  
**Source:** PJM Interconnection LLC (publicly available)  
**Time Period:** 2002‚Äì2018 (16 years)  
**Granularity:** Hourly electricity consumption measurements  
**File:** `pjm_energy.csv`  
**Size:** 145,366 records after preprocessing  

## What This Data Represents

PJM (Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland Interconnection) operates the largest electric grid in North America. The dataset contains historical records showing how much electricity was consumed each hour across PJM's service region.

Each entry represents the total megawatt-hours (MW) of electricity used by millions of homes and businesses over 16 years.

## Why This Data Fits the Project

### 1. Relevance to Green AI

Energy forecasting has a direct link to carbon emissions because:

- **Grid Inefficiency:** Utilities keep fossil-fuel plants on standby ("spinning reserves") in case demand suddenly spikes.
- **Renewable Integration:** Better forecasts allow smoother integration of solar and wind, which fluctuate with weather.
- **Peak Shaving:** Accurate predictions reduce reliance on expensive, high-emission peaker plants.

In short, using ML to forecast demand means fewer fossil fuels burned ‚Äî and a smaller carbon footprint overall.

### 2. Real-World Applicability

- **Deployment:** The model could easily scale to 70M+ smart meters in the US.
- **Prediction Frequency:** Hourly forecasts, 365 days a year.
- **Scale:** Billions of predictions annually.
- **Carbon Impact:** Even a tiny inference improvement scales into huge emissions savings.

This isn't just a simulation ‚Äî utilities actually deploy models like this in real operations.

## Data Readiness

### Preprocessing Steps

**1. Handling Missing Values**

- Checked for NaNs in `Datetime` and `PJME_MW`.
- Dropped 336 rows with missing values (~0.2% of the dataset).
- Verified no duplicate timestamps.

**2. Feature Engineering**

- Extracted time-based features: hour, day of week, month, and quarter.
- Added cyclical encodings for time patterns (`sin(hour)`, `cos(hour)`, etc.).
- Created lag features (previous hour's consumption).
- Calculated rolling averages (24-hour and 7-day).

**3. Train/Test Split**

- 80% for training (116,158 samples).
- 20% for testing (29,040 samples).
- Used a chronological split to prevent data leakage.

**4. Scaling**

- Applied `StandardScaler` for the Ridge model.
- Kept original values for RandomForest (no scaling needed for trees).

### Data Quality

- **No Outlier Removal:** Spikes represent real demand events (heatwaves, cold snaps).
- **Temporal Consistency:** Maintained hourly intervals.
- **Stationarity:** Seasonal patterns observed, as expected for energy data.

## Reliability & Bias

### Reliability

‚úÖ **Trusted Source:** PJM is a regulated and audited utility.  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive:** Covers 16 continuous years of data.  
‚úÖ **Verified:** Cross-checked against FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) records.  

### Potential Biases

‚ö†Ô∏è **Geographic Bias:**

- Data covers only the PJM region (US East Coast).
- May not represent grids in other regions like California or Texas.
- Climate patterns are specific to the Mid-Atlantic area.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Temporal Bias:**

- Data stops in 2018, before the 2020 renewable energy growth and EV adoption boom.
- Doesn't capture post-COVID demand changes or work-from-home effects.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Aggregation Bias:**

- Represents total regional demand ‚Äî no city- or household-level granularity.
- Hides local consumption differences.

### How I Addressed These Biases

- **Model Simplicity:** Focused on general, time-based features that transfer across regions.
- **Conservative Claims:** Limited results to US grid applications.
- **Transparency:** Clearly documented the dataset's regional scope and limitations.

## Data Sufficiency

### Is This Enough Data?

‚úÖ **Yes ‚Äî perfectly sufficient for energy forecasting.**

- Over 145,000 samples, ideal for Ridge or RandomForest models.
- 16 years of history captures seasonal, economic, and weather-related cycles.
- Achieved R¬≤ = 0.91, confirming strong predictive signal.

### What's Missing?

If more data were available, I'd include:

- **Weather features:** Temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- **Economic indicators:** GDP, industrial activity, etc.
- **Regional detail:** City- or county-level energy data.
- **Recent years (2019‚Äì2024):** To capture EV adoption and post-pandemic usage trends.

Still, this dataset is more than enough to demonstrate Green AI in action.

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy

‚úÖ **No Personal Data:** Aggregated regional totals only.  
‚úÖ **No Individual Meters:** Nothing identifiable.  
‚úÖ **Public Dataset:** Already published by PJM.  

### Fairness

The model doesn't discriminate:

- It doesn't use demographic or location-specific individual data.
- Predictions apply to total regional consumption.
- It doesn't affect access to electricity ‚Äî everyone remains served equally.

### Potential Harms

‚ö†Ô∏è **Possible Misuse:**  
Forecasts like this could be used by utilities to:

- Justify higher prices during peak hours.
- Reduce service in low-profit areas.

**Mitigation:** My approach is focused solely on grid optimization and carbon reduction, not pricing or profit.
